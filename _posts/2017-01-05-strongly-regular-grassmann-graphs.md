I would like to determine the parameters of the Grassmann graphs that are strongly regular. To this end, my primary goal is to verify that:

* For all natural numbers $$n \geq 4$$ and prime powers $$q$$, the Grassmann graph $$J_q(n,2)$$ is an $$\operatorname{SRG}\left ( {n \brack 2}_{q}, q {2 \brack 1}_{q}  {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} , \left ( q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} - 1 \right ) + q^{2}, \left ( {2 \brack 1}_{q} \right )^{2} \right)$$.

Suppose that we are given an arbitrary natural number $$n \geq 4$$ and prime power $$q$$. Let $$S = \{ W : W \leq V \operatorname{and} \operatorname{dim}{W} = 2  \}$$ denote the set of all subspaces of dimension $$2$$ of a vector space $$V$$ of dimension $$n$$ over the finite field $$\mathbb{F}_{q}$$ of order $$q$$. Consider the simple graph $$G = \left ( S, E \right )$$ formed with the set $$S$$ as vertices and the set $$E = \{ \{W, Z\} : W, Z \in S \operatorname{and} \operatorname{dim}(W \cap Z) = 1 \}$$ as edges. Then:

1. Select an arbitrary $$W \in S$$, select an arbitrary one-dimensional subspace $$L$$ of $$W$$, and let $$S_{W, L} = \{ X : X \in S \operatorname{and} {X \cap W} = L \}$$ denote the subset of $$S$$ of two-dimensional subspaces of $$V$$ that share exactly $$L$$ in common with $$W$$. Select an arbitrary $$Y \in S_{W,L}$$: since $$\left\vert{Y \setminus L}\right\vert = \left\vert{Y}\right\vert - \left\vert{L}\right\vert = q^{2} - q$$ and $$\left ( Y \setminus L \right ) \subseteq \left ( V \setminus W \right )$$, we have that $$\left\vert\{ v : v \in \left ( V \setminus W \right ) \operatorname{and} Y = L \oplus \operatorname{span}\{v\} \} \right\vert = q^{2} - q$$, which is independent of our choice of $$Y$$. This means here that for each of the $$\left\vert{V \setminus W}\right\vert = q^{n} - q^{2}$$ ways to select a non-zero vector in $$ v \in \left(V \setminus W\right)$$ in order to construct a two-dimensional subspace $$Y = L \oplus \operatorname{span}\{v\} \in S_{W,L}$$, there will be a total of $$q^{2} - q$$ elements of $$\left(V \setminus W\right)$$ that could be selected to construct the same subspace $$Y \in S_{W, L}$$ in this way. It is then possible to deduce that $$\left\vert{S_{W, L}}\right\vert = \frac{q^{n} - q^{2}}{q^{2} - q} = q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q}$$, which is independent of our particular choices of $$W$$ and $$L$$. Therefore the number of two-dimensional subspaces of $$V$$ that share exactly a particular one-dimensional subspace of $$V$$ in common with a particular two-dimensional subspace of $$V$$ is given in general by $$q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q}$$, independent of particular choices of a one-dimensional subspace and a two-dimensional subspace of $$V$$; I will make use of this fact in the next two steps towards achieving my goal for this post.

2. Select an arbitrary $$W \in S$$, and let $$N(W)$$ denote the neighbourhood of $$W$$ on $$G$$. Then there are $${2 \brack 1}_{q}$$ ways to select a one-dimensional subspace of $$W$$, and for each one-dimensional subspace $$L$$ of $$W$$, we have from my previous point that $$\left\vert{S_{W, L}}\right\vert = \left\vert{\{ X : X \in S \operatorname{and} {X \cap W} = L\}}\right\vert =  q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q}$$ other two-dimensional subspaces of $$V$$ in $$S$$ that share exactly $$L$$ in common with $$W$$. It is then possible to deduce that $$\left\vert{N(W)}\right\vert = {2 \brack 1}_{q} \left ( q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} \right ) = q {2 \brack 1}_{q}  {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q}$$, which is independent of $$W$$. Therefore $$G$$ in this context is $$q {2 \brack 1}_{q}  {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q}$$-regular. 

3. Select an arbitrary $$\{W, X \} \in E$$, and let $$L = W \cap X$$. Additionally, let $$T = N(W) \cap N(X)$$, where $$N(W)$$ and $$N(X)$$ denote the respective neighbourhoods of $$W$$ and $$X$$ on $$G$$. Partition $$T = T_1 \sqcup T_2$$ into disjoint subsets $$T_1 = \{ Z : Z \in \left ( S \setminus X \right ) \operatorname{and} W \cap Z = L \}$$  and $$T_2 = \{ \operatorname{span}\{w\} \oplus \operatorname{span}\{x\} : w \in \left ( W \setminus L \right ) \operatorname{and} x \in \left ( X \setminus L \right ) \}$$. By similar reasoning as in previous points, we get that $$\left\vert{T_1}\right\vert = q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} - 1$$, additionally subtracting one to exclude $$X$$ from the count of two-dimensional subspaces of $$V$$ that share exactly $$L$$ in common with $$W$$. There are then $$\left ( \frac{\left\vert W \setminus L \right\vert}{q - 1} \right ) \left ( \frac{\left\vert X \setminus L \right\vert}{q - 1} \right ) = \left ( \frac{q^{2} - q}{q - 1} \right )\left ( \frac{q^{2} - q}{q - 1} \right ) = q^{2}$$ ways to select a one-dimensional subspace of $$L_1$$ of $$W$$ and then select a one-dimensional $$L_2$$ of $$X$$ in order to construct a two-dimensional subspace $$Y = L_1 \oplus L_2 \in S$$ of V such that $$Y \cap L = \{ 0 \}$$; this means here that $$\left\vert{T_{2}}\right\vert = q^{2}$$. Hence $$\left\vert{T}\right\vert = \left\vert{T_1 \sqcup T_2}\right\vert = \left\vert{T_1}\right\vert + \left\vert{T_2}\right\vert = \left ( q^{2} {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} - 1 \right ) + q^{2}$$. Therefore every pair of adjacent vertices on $$G$$ share $$\left ( q^{2} {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} - 1 \right ) + q^{2}$$ neighbours in common, since the choice of edge in this context is arbitrary.

4. Select an arbitrary pair $$W$$ and $$X$$ of distinct non-adjacent vertices in $$S$$. Then there $$\left({2 \brack 1}_q \right)\left({2 \brack 1}_q \right) = \left({2 \brack 1}_q \right)^{2}$$ ways to select a one-dimensional subspace $$L_1$$ of $$W$$ and then select a one-dimensional subspace $$L_2$$ of $$X$$ in order to construct a two-dimensional subspace $$Y = L_1 \oplus L_2 \in S$$ of $$V$$ such that $$Y \cap W = L_1$$ and $$Y \cap X = L_2$$; this means here that $$W$$ and $$X$$ share $$\left({2 \brack 1}_q \right)^{2}$$ neighbours in common. Therefore every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices on $$G$$ share $$\left({2 \brack 1}_q \right)^{2}$$ neighbours in common, since $$W$$ and $$X$$ in this context are arbitrary.

Hence $$G \cong J_q(n,2)$$ is an $$\operatorname{SRG}\left ( {n \brack 2}_{q}, q {2 \brack 1}_{q}  {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} , \left ( q {n - 2 \brack 1}_{q} - 1 \right ) + q^{2}, \left ( {2 \brack 1}_{q} \right )^{2} \right)$$; the general result then follows, since $$n$$ and $$q$$ in this context are arbitrary.

Note that $$J_q(n,k) \cong J_q(n, n - k)$$, the diameter of $$J_q(n,k)$$ is $$\operatorname{min}(k, n - k)$$, and $$J_q(n,k)$$ is strongly regular if and only if its diameter is 2 for all natural numbers $$n,k$$ where $$k \leq n$$ and prime powers $$q$$. The parameters of any strongly regular Grassmann graph can then be deduced from this, together with the result that I have verified in this post.
