    <p>In this post, my goal is to verify that a pair of simple graphs are cospectral if and only if their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal.</p>

<p>Suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is a simple graph with adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script>. Then, first and foremost, I would like to give a couple of definitions in this context:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The generating series closed walks on <script type="math/tex">G</script> weighted by length is given by <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) := \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \operatorname{tr}(A^{n}) X^{n}</script> - assuming, for the purposes of this post, the fact that <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{tr}(A^{n})</script> gives the total number of closed walks of length <script type="math/tex">n</script> on <script type="math/tex">G</script> for all <script type="math/tex">n \geq 0</script>.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note that here <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) \in \mathbb{R}[[X]]</script>, i.e. it is an element of the algebra of formal power series with real coefficients.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose that the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of <script type="math/tex">G</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(x)</script>. Additionally, suppose that <script type="math/tex">H</script> is another simple graph where the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of <script type="math/tex">H</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">\phi_{H}(x)</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are said to be cospectral if <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(x) = \phi_{H}(x)</script>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, in order to achieve my original goal for this post of verifying that a pair of simple graphs are cospectral if and only if their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal, I would first like to necessarily propose that the following facts hold in this context:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that minimal polynomial of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">p(x) = \prod\limits_{k = 1}^{n} \left (x - \lambda_k \right )</script>. Additionally, suppose that <script type="math/tex">A</script> has the spectral decomposition <script type="math/tex">A = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda E_\lambda</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> is the set whose elements consist of all of the roots of <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script>. Then the generating series <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X)</script> for all closed walks on <script type="math/tex">G</script> weighted by length admits the partial fraction decomposition <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{\operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda})}{1 - \lambda X}</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> has the spectral decomposition <script type="math/tex">A = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda E_\lambda</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> is the set whose elements consist of the distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, then <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{tr}(E_\lambda) = m_{\lambda}</script> gives the multiplicity <script type="math/tex">m_{\lambda}</script> of <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> as an eigenvalue of <script type="math/tex">A</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\lambda \in \sigma(A)</script>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming that these facts hold in this context, then it is possible to then further deduce that the generating series <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X)</script> for all closed walks on <script type="math/tex">G</script> weighted by length admits a closed form as a rational expression involving the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> and its formal derivative relative to a certain formal symbol in context, which will be useful for achieving my original goal of verifying that a pair of simple graphs are cospectral if and only if their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose that the closed walk generating series <script type="math/tex">W_G(X)</script> of all closed walks on <script type="math/tex">G</script> weighted by length admits the partial fraction decomposition <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{m_{\lambda}}{1 - \lambda X}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> is the set whose elements consist of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and each <script type="math/tex">m_{\lambda}</script> denotes the multiplicity of <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> as an eigenvalue of <script type="math/tex">A</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\lambda \in \sigma(A)</script>. Additionally, suppose that the characteristic polynomial <script type="math/tex">\phi(x)</script> of <script type="math/tex">A</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">\phi(x) = \prod\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \left ( x - \lambda \right )^{m_{\lambda}}</script>. Then, we can further deduce from here that:</li>
</ol>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">W_{G}(X)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{m_{\lambda}}{1 - \lambda X}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \left ( \frac{X^{-1}}{X^{-1}} \right ) \frac{m_{\lambda}}{1 - \lambda X}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{m_{\lambda} X^{-1}}{X^{-1} - \lambda}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= X^{-1} \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{m_{\lambda}}{X^{-1} - \lambda}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= X^{-1} \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)}  \left ( \frac{ \left ( \frac{\phi(X^{-1})}{X^{-1} - \lambda} \right )}{ \left ( \frac{\phi(X^{-1})}{X^{-1} - \lambda} \right )} \right ) \frac{m_{\lambda}}{X^{-1} - \lambda}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= X^{-1} \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{m_{\lambda} \left ( \frac{\phi(X^{-1})}{X^{-1} - \lambda} \right )}{\phi(X^{-1})}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{X^{-1} \left ( \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} m_{\lambda} \left ( \frac{\phi(X^{-1})}{X^{-1} - \lambda} \right ) \right )}{\phi(X^{-1})}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{X^{-1} \phi^{'}(X^{-1})}{\phi(X^{-1})}</script>

<p>.</p>

<p><em>Note that here <script type="math/tex">X^{-1}</script> denotes another formal symbol that happens to have the relation <script type="math/tex">X^{-1}X = 1</script> with the formal symbol <script type="math/tex">X</script> and should not be interpreted as a “function of <script type="math/tex">X</script>” in the sense of calculus when e.g. considering the formal derivative <script type="math/tex">\phi^{'}(X^{-1})</script> of <script type="math/tex">\phi(X^{-1})</script> with respect to the formal symbol <script type="math/tex">X^{-1}</script> in context.</em></p>

<p>I would now like to show that the previous two facts that I assumed to be true indeed hold in this context:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the left-shift operator <script type="math/tex">T : \mathbb{R}[[X]] \to \mathbb{R}[[X]]</script> acting on the algebra <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}[[X]]</script> of formal power series with real coefficients, defined as <script type="math/tex">T \left ( \sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n X^{n} \right ) := \sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_{n + 1} X^{n}</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n X^{n} \in \mathbb{R}[[X]]</script>; I would like to assume, for the purposes of this post, that this operator is indeed linear and that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}[[X]]</script> can be interpreted as a vector space. Then, core linear algebra tells us that given the minimal polynomial <script type="math/tex">p(x) = \prod\limits_{k = 1}^{j} \left (x - \lambda_k \right )</script> of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script>, <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{null}(p(T))</script> admits the direct sum decomposition <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{null}(p(T)) = \oplus_{k = 1}^{j} \operatorname{null}(T - \lambda_{k} I) = \oplus_{k = 1}^{j} \operatorname{span} \left \{ \frac{1}{1 - \lambda_k X} \right \}</script>; I would also ask, for the purposes of this blog post, that you believe me that this fact from linear algebra is indeed true - and also the fact that a formal power series <script type="math/tex">A(X) \in \mathbb{R}[[X]]</script> is an eigenvector for an eigenvalue <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> of <script type="math/tex">T</script> if and only if <script type="math/tex">A(X)</script> is a (non-zero) scalar multiple of <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{1 - \lambda X}</script>. Now, from linearity properties of the trace map <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{tr} : \operatorname{Mat}_{d \times d}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}</script> where <script type="math/tex">d</script> denotes the number of vertices on <script type="math/tex">G</script> in this context, we can deduce that <script type="math/tex">W_G(X) \in \operatorname{null}(p(T)) = \oplus_{k = 1}^{j} \operatorname{span} \left \{ \frac{1}{1 - \lambda_k X} \right \}</script>; hence we can deduce that <script type="math/tex">W_G(X) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{j} \frac{c_k}{1 - \lambda_k X}</script> for some unique scalars <script type="math/tex">c_k \in \mathbb{R}</script> for all <script type="math/tex">1 \leq k \leq j</script>. However, if we know that the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> has the spectral decomposition <script type="math/tex">A = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda E_{\lambda}</script> where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> denotes the set of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, then it turns out that <script type="math/tex">A^{n}</script> has the spectral decomposition <script type="math/tex">A^{n} = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda^{n} E_{\lambda}</script> for all <script type="math/tex">n \geq 0</script>; and hence it turns out that <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{tr}(A^{n}) = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda^{n} \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda})</script> for all <script type="math/tex">n \geq 0</script> by linearity properties of trace. If we consider the fact that the <script type="math/tex">n</script>-th coefficient of <script type="math/tex">W_G(X)</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{tr}(A^{n}) = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda^{n} \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda}) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{j} \lambda_{k}^{n} \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda_k})</script> and is also given by the <script type="math/tex">0</script>-th coefficient of <script type="math/tex">T^{n} \left ( \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{j} \frac{c_k}{1 - \lambda_k X} \right )</script> which is equal to <script type="math/tex">\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{j} \lambda_{k}^{n} c_k</script> for all <script type="math/tex">n \geq 0</script>, then we see that each <script type="math/tex">c_k = \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda_k})</script> for all <script type="math/tex">1 \leq k \leq j</script> since each <script type="math/tex">c_k</script> is unique. Hence we ultimately get that <script type="math/tex">W_G(X)</script> admits the partial fraction decomposition <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) = \sum\limits_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \frac{\operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda})}{1 - \lambda X}</script> as desired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the spectral idempotent <script type="math/tex">E_\lambda</script> for an arbitrary <script type="math/tex">\lambda \in \sigma(A)</script> where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> denotes the set of distinct eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script>. Then, since <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}^{2} = E_{\lambda}</script> we can see that <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}^{2} - E_{\lambda} = 0</script> and hence that the minimal polynomial of <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> of <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">p(x) = x(x - 1)</script>; since <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> splits into distinct linear factors, this means that <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}</script> is diagonalizable with <script type="math/tex">1</script>s and <script type="math/tex">0</script>s lying along the diagonal matrix that it is similar to. Since the rank of the diagonal matrix that <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}</script> is similar to is equal to the rank of <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}</script>, and since the only non-zero entries in the diagonal matrix that <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}</script> is similar to will be <script type="math/tex">1</script>s lying along said matrix’s diagonal, we can deduce that <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{rank}(E_{\lambda}) = \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda})</script>. Lastly, since <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{rank}(E_{\lambda}) = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{null}(A - \lambda I))</script>, and since the multiplicity <script type="math/tex">m_\lambda</script> of <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> as a eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">m_\lambda = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{null}(A - \lambda I))</script>, we get that <script type="math/tex">m_\lambda = \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda})</script>. Therefore we get that <script type="math/tex">m_{\lambda^{'}} = \operatorname{tr}(E_{\lambda_{'}})</script> for all <script type="math/tex">\lambda^{'} \in \sigma(A)</script>, since our choice of <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> in this context is arbitrary.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I would like to break out of this context here and conclude that in general the closed walk generating series admits a closed form as a rational expression in the sense that I’ve shown is true in this context, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> in this context is arbitrary.
I would next like to move onward to achieving my original goal of verifying that a pair of simple graphs are cospectral if and only if their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are a pair of cospectral simple graphs, where the respective characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrices of <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are denoted by <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(x)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\phi_{H}(x)</script>. Then, assuming that my previous result is true, we can see that the respective generating series <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X)</script> and <script type="math/tex">W_{H}(X)</script> for all closed walks on <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> weighted by length admit closed forms as rational expressions given by <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) = \frac{X^{-1} \phi_{G}^{'}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{G}(X^{-1})}</script> and <script type="math/tex">W_{H}(X) = \frac{X^{-1} \phi_{H}^{'}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{H}(X^{-1})}</script>. However, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are cospectral, we know that in particular <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(X^{-1}) = \phi_{H}(X^{-1})</script> and can further deduce that <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}^{'}(X^{-1}) = \phi_{H}^{'}(X^{-1})</script> as well. Hence, it is quite clear that <script type="math/tex">W_{G}(X) = W_{H}(X)</script> in this context; therefore, if any pair simple graphs of are cospectral, then their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length must be equal, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> in this context are arbitrary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are a pair of simple graphs whose respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal, i.e <script type="math/tex">W_G(X) = W_H(X)</script>. Then, assuming my previous result, we know that <script type="math/tex">\frac{X^{-1} \phi_{G}^{'}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{G}(X^{-1})} = \frac{X^{-1} \phi_{H}^{'}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{H}(X^{-1})}</script> where <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(x)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\phi_{H}(x)</script> denote the respective characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrices of <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script>. From this, we can ultimately deduce that <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}^{'}(X^{-1}) \phi_{H}(X^{-1}) = \phi_{G}(X^{-1})\phi_{H}^{'}(X^{-1})</script> and furthermore that <script type="math/tex">\left ( \frac{\phi_{G}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{H}(X^{-1})} \right )^{'} = 0</script>. Lastly, since characteristic polynomials are monic, we can then deduce that <script type="math/tex">\frac{\phi_{G}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{H}(X^{-1})} = 1</script> from the fact that <script type="math/tex">\left ( \frac{\phi_{G}(X^{-1})}{\phi_{H}(X^{-1})} \right )^{'} = 0</script>. Hence we get that <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(X^{-1}) = \phi_{H}(X^{-1})</script> and can see that <script type="math/tex">\phi_{G}(x) = \phi_{H}(x)</script>. Therefore, we can conclude that <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> are cospectral because their respective characteristic polynomials are equal; we can also more generally conclude that if the respective generating series for closed walks weighted by length of a pair of simple graphs are equal, then they must be cospectral, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> in this context are arbitrary.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, we can ultimately conclude from this post that a pair of simple graphs are cospectral if and only if their respective generating series for all closed walks weighted by length are equal, as desired.</p>
