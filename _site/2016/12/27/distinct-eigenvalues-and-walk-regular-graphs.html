    <p>In this post, my goals are to verify that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Every regular connected graph with at most four distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular.</li>
  <li>Every regular triangle-free connected graph with at most five distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular.</li>
  <li>Every regular bipartite connected graph with at most six distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular.</li>
</ol>

<p>Firstly, suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is an arbitrary <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular connected graph on <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices with adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and moreover suppose that <script type="math/tex">A</script> has exactly four distinct eigenvalues. 
Let the set of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script> be then denoted by <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A) = \{ k, \alpha, \beta, \gamma \}</script>, assuming for the purposes of this blog post the fact a <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular graph always has <script type="math/tex">k</script> as one of its distinct eigenvalues. It is then possible to deduce that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Z(A)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, \cdots \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, A^{3} \}</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> since <script type="math/tex">A</script> has four distinct eigenvalues, which means here that the minimal polynomial of <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a monic polynomial of degree 4 and hence <script type="math/tex">A^j</script> can be expressed as linear combination of <script type="math/tex">I, A, A^{2}</script> and <script type="math/tex">A^{3}</script> for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 4</script> <strong>]</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma} \}</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> letting <script type="math/tex">\{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}</script>, <script type="math/tex">E_{\gamma} \}</script> denote a set of spectral idempotents for <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and assuming the fact that the span of the set of all powers of the adjacency matrix of a simple graph is equal to the span of a set of spectral idempotents for said graph <strong>]</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ J, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma} \}</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> assuming that <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{n} J</script> is a spectral idempotent for eigenvalue <script type="math/tex">k</script> of a <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular connected graph on <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices where <script type="math/tex">J</script> denotes the <script type="math/tex">n \times n</script> matrix consisting of all ones <strong>]</strong>. This means, in particular, that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">J = a_3 A^{3} + a_2 A^{2} + a_1 A + a_0 I</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> for some <script type="math/tex">a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \in \mathbb{R}</script> <strong>]</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\implies A^{3} = \frac{1}{a_3} \left ( J - a_2 A^{2} - a_1 A - a_0 I \right )</script>

<p>.</p>

<p>It ultimately follows from this that <script type="math/tex">A^{3}</script> has a constant diagonal, assuming that <script type="math/tex">J, A^{2}, A</script>, and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals as well; aside from the fact that <script type="math/tex">J, A</script>, and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals by construction here, <script type="math/tex">A^{2}</script> has a constant diagonal because <script type="math/tex">G</script> is <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular and so each diagonal entry of <script type="math/tex">A^{2}</script> counts the <script type="math/tex">k</script> number of closed walks between each respective vertex of <script type="math/tex">G</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> can be written as a linear combination of <script type="math/tex">A^{3}, A^{2}, A</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 4</script>, we have that <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> has a constant diagonal for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 4</script> as well. This means here that all of the vertices of <script type="math/tex">G</script> are cospectral, since it follows from this that the relative generating series for closed walks weighted by length for each of the respective vertices of <script type="math/tex">G</script> are all equal to each other. Hence <script type="math/tex">G</script> is then walk-regular since all of its vertices are cospectral, and therefore every regular with four distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular since <script type="math/tex">G</script> in this context is arbitrary. Additionally, it follows that every regular graph with at most three distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular from the fact that <script type="math/tex">I, A,</script> and <script type="math/tex">A^2</script> all have constant diagonals for any regular graph whose adjacency matrix is denoted by <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and moreover from the fact that this ultimately means that the vertices of every regular graph with at most three distinct eigenvalues are all cospectral by similar reasoning as before. Therefore we finally have that every regular connected graph with at most four distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular as desired.</p>

<p>Secondly, suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is an arbitrary <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular triangle-free connected graph with adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and moreover suppose that <script type="math/tex">A</script> has exactly five distinct eigenvalues. By using the same assumptions as in the last paragraph, letting <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A) = \{ k, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \}</script> denote the set of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and letting <script type="math/tex">\{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta} \}</script> denote a set of spectral idempotents for <script type="math/tex">A</script>, it is then possible to similarly deduce that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Z(A)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, \cdots \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, A^{3}, A^{4} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ J, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\implies J = a_4 A^{4} + a_3 A^{3} + a_2 A^{2} + a_1 A + a_0 I</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> for some <script type="math/tex">a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \in \mathbb{R}</script> <strong>]</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\implies A^{4} = \frac{1}{a_4} \left ( J - a_3 A^{3} - a_2 A^{2} - a_1 A - a_0 I \right )</script>

<p>.</p>

<p>This means that <script type="math/tex">A^{4}</script> here has a constant diagonal, assuming that <script type="math/tex">J, A^{3}, A^{2}, A</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals; in addition to the fact that <script type="math/tex">J, A^{2}, A,</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals for similar reasons as in the last paragraph, <script type="math/tex">A^{3}</script> has constant diagonal here because <script type="math/tex">G</script> is a triangle-free graph and hence has no closed walks of length three between any of its vertices and themselves. Since <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> can be written as a linear combination of <script type="math/tex">A^{4}, A^{3}, A^{2}, A</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 5</script>, we have that <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> has a constant diagonal for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 5</script> as well. This then ultimately means that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is walk-regular, for similar reasons as in the last paragraph as well; hence every regular triangle-free graph with five distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> in this context is arbitrary. Therefore every regular triangle-free connected graph with at most five distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular, since a regular triangle-free connected graph with less than five distinct eigenvalues can be interpreted as a regular connected graph with at most four distinct eigenvalues and from the last paragraph every regular connected graph with at most four distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular.</p>

<p>Lastly, suppose that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is an arbitrary <script type="math/tex">k</script>-regular bipartite connected graph with adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and moreover suppose that <script type="math/tex">A</script> has exactly six distinct eigenvalues. By using the same assumptions as the last two paragraphs, letting the set of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script> be then denoted by <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A) = \{ k, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon \}</script> the set of distinct eigenvalues of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and letting <script type="math/tex">\{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta}, E_{\epsilon} \}</script> denote a set of spectral idempotents for <script type="math/tex">A</script>, it is then possible to again similarly deduce that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Z(A)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, \cdots \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ I, A, A^{2}, A^{3}, A^{4}, A^{5} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ E_{k}, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta}, E_{\epsilon} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{span} \{ J, E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{\gamma}, E_{\delta}, E_{\epsilon} \}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\implies J = a_5 A^{5} + a_4 A^{4} + a_3 A^{3} + a_2 A^{2} + a_1 A + a_0 I</script>

<p><strong>[</strong> for some <script type="math/tex">a_5, a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \in \mathbb{R}</script> <strong>]</strong></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\implies A^{4} = \frac{1}{a_4} \left ( J - a_5 A^{5} - a_3 A^{3} - a_2 A^{2} - a_1 A - a_0 I \right )</script>

<p>.</p>

<p>This means that <script type="math/tex">A^{4}</script> here has a constant diagonal, assuming that <script type="math/tex">J, A^{5}, A^{3}, A^{2}, A</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals; in addition to the fact that <script type="math/tex">J, A^{2}, A,</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> all have constant diagonals for similar reasons as in the last two paragraphs, <script type="math/tex">A^{3}</script> and <script type="math/tex">A^{5}</script> both have constant diagonals here because <script type="math/tex">G</script> is a bipartite graph and hence has no closed walks of odd length between any of its vertices and themselves. <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> can be written as a linear combination of <script type="math/tex">A^{5}, A^{4}, A^{3}, A^{2}, A</script> and <script type="math/tex">I</script> for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 6</script>, we have that <script type="math/tex">A^{j}</script> has a constant diagonal for all <script type="math/tex">j \geq 6</script> as well. This then ultimately means that <script type="math/tex">G</script> is walk-regular, for similar reasons as in the last two paragraphs; hence every regular bipartite connected graph with six distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular, since <script type="math/tex">G</script> in this context is arbitrary. Therefore every regular bipartite connected graph with at most six distinct eigenvalues is walk-regular, since a regular bipartite connected graph with five distinct eigenvalues is just a regular triangle-free connected graph with five distinct eigenvalues and a regular bipartite graph with at most four distince distinct eigenvalues is just a regular connected graph with at most four distinct eigenvalues.</p>

<p>I have verified the desired results about families of walk-regular graphs that exist due to the number of distinct eigenvalues that they have and hence have achieved my goals for this post. More generally, I think it would be interesting to decide whether more families of walk-regular graphs exist due to the number of distinct eigenvalues that they have exist, identify what these families of walk-regular graphs might be if more do exist, and find more general results that e.g. subsume the results in the current blog post presented here. As one last closing remark, it may be worth mentioning that the first example of a cubic walk-regular graph that is neither vertex-transitive nor distance-regular that I found is a bipartite connected graph with six distinct eigenvalues - could it be possible to e.g. identity other families of walk-regular graphs that e.g. cubic (bipartite connected) walk-regular graphs that are neither vertex-transitive nor distance-regular must necessarily otherwise belong to based on e.g. properties of their spectra, should more examples exist?</p>
