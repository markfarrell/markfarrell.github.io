  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I would like to continue to talk about my investigations into what simple graphs admit the properties known as perfect state transfer and uniform mixing relative to their adjacency matrices. In this particular post, my goals are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that the only complete graph that admits the property known as perfect state transfer is <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that the only complete graphs that admit the property known as uniform mixing are <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, <script type="math/tex">K_3</script>, and <script type="math/tex">K_4</script>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In order to show that the only complete graph that admits perfect state transfer is <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, I would like to first assume that if a simple graph admits perfect state transfer between a pair of distinct vertices at a particular time, then said pair of distinct vertices must also satisfy the property known as being strongly cospectral. A pair of distinct vertices on a simple graph are said to be strongly cospectral if they are both cospectral and parallel. I’ve previously discussed a few characterizations and sufficient conditions for a pair of distinct vertices to be considered cospectral on a simple graph: for an initial discussion on what it means for a pair of distinct vertices on a simple graph to be cospectral, please see my past <a href="https://m4farrel.quora.com/Closed-Walks-and-Cospectral-Vertices">blog post</a> on the matter. On the other hand, I’ve yet to define what it means for a pair of distinct vertices to be parallel on a simple graph: a pair of distinct vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> on a simple graph <script type="math/tex">G</script> are said to be parallel if <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}e_u</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_{\lambda}e_v</script> are linearly dependent for all <script type="math/tex">\lambda \in \sigma(A)</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma(A)</script> denotes the set of distinct eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script>. With those definitions in mind, I would like to proceed to show that unless <script type="math/tex">n = 2</script>, the complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> does not have any strongly cospectral vertices; and hence show that unless <script type="math/tex">n = 2</script>, the complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> does not admit perfect state transfer, since strong cospectrality is necessary condition for a simple graph to admit perfect state transfer between a pair of distinct vertices.</p>

<p>We also saw in one of my <a href="https://m4farrel.quora.com/Complete-Graphs-Are-Characterized-by-Their-Spectra">previous blog posts</a> that the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of a complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> on <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices has the spectral decomposition <script type="math/tex">A = (n - 1)E_{n-1} - E_{-1}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">E_{n-1} = \frac{1}{n} J</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_{-1} = I - \frac{1}{n} J</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">E_{n-1}</script> is a rank-one matrix, it is apparent that <script type="math/tex">E_{n-1}e_u</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_{n-1}e_v</script> are linearly dependent for any pair of distinct vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> on <script type="math/tex">K_n</script>; so to check that a pair of distinct vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> on <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> are parallel, it suffices to check that <script type="math/tex">E_{-1}e_u</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_{-1}e_v</script> are linearly dependent. Assuming that the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality holds for the standard inner product and norm on <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^{n}</script>, we can check whether or not equality holds for <script type="math/tex">\mid \langle E_{-1}e_u, E_{-1}e_v \rangle \mid \leq \lVert E_{-1} e_u \rVert \lVert E_{-1}e_u \rVert</script> in order to decide whether or not <script type="math/tex">E_{-1}e_u</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_{-1}e_v</script> are linearly dependent for a pair of distinct vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> on <script type="math/tex">K_n</script>. By inspection, it is apparent that this equality does not hold for any pair of vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> on <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> unless <script type="math/tex">n = 2</script>, in which case it holds for the only pair of distinct vertices on <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>; hence we already know the only complete graph that could potentially admit perfect state transfer is <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, since any other complete graph does not have any parallel vertices, and hence does not have any strongly cospectral vertices either.</p>

<p>I would now like to verify that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> indeed admits perfect state transfer between its only pair of distinct vertices. For <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, we know that its only pair of vertices are strongly cospectral because they are parallel, and are also cospectral because there is an automorphism on <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> that sends one vertex to the other; so we have reason to believe that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> could potentially admit perfect state transfer between its only pair of distinct vertices. We can in fact verify that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> indeed admits perfect state transfer between its only pair of distinct vertices now using a direct approach. For the purposes of this particular blog post, I would like to assume another fact that if the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> of a simple graph <script type="math/tex">G</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">A = \sum_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \lambda E_{\lambda}</script>, then the spectral decomposition of its continuous-time quantum walk relative to its adjacency matrix is given by <script type="math/tex">U(t) = \sum_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} \operatorname{exp}(it(\lambda)) E_{\lambda}</script>. Then, the continuous-time quantum walk of <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> relative to its adjacency matrix is given by:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">U(t)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{exp}(itA)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{exp}(it)E_{1} + \operatorname{exp}(-it)E_{-1}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \operatorname{exp}(it)J + \operatorname{exp}(-it)(I - J)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= (\operatorname{exp}(it) - \operatorname{exp}(-it)) J + \operatorname{exp}(-it)I</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= (\operatorname{exp}(it) - \operatorname{exp}(-it)) (J - I) + (\operatorname{exp}(-it) + (\operatorname{exp}(it) - \operatorname{exp}(-it))) I</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= (\operatorname{exp}(it) - \operatorname{exp}(-it)) A + \operatorname{exp}(it)I</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= i (2 sin(t)) A + \operatorname{exp}(it)I</script>

<p>.</p>

<p>We can further see that if <script type="math/tex">U(t)e_1 = \operatorname{exp}(i \theta) e_2</script> at some time <script type="math/tex">t \in \mathbb{R}</script> and for some angle <script type="math/tex">\theta \in [0, 2 \pi]</script>, i.e. <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> admits perfect state transfer between its only pair of distinct vertices at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>, then <script type="math/tex">sin(t) = 0</script> and <script type="math/tex">t = \theta</script>. Hence we can deduce that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> indeed admits perfect state transfer between its only pair of distinct vertices at time <script type="math/tex">t = \frac{\pi}{2}</script>; moreover, together with the fact from the previous paragraph the <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> does not have any strongly cospectral vertices unless <script type="math/tex">n = 2</script>, we can conclude that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script> is the only complete graph that admits perfect state transfer.</p>

<p>I would now like to move on to verify that <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, <script type="math/tex">K_3</script> and <script type="math/tex">K_4</script> are the only complete graphs that admit uniform mixing. Recalling the definition of what it means for a simple graph to admit uniform mixing relative to its adjacency matrix from one of <a href="https://m4farrel.quora.com/Perfect-State-Transfer-and-Uniform-Mixing-on-Cartesian-Products-of-Graphs">my previous posts</a>, We can deduce a general expression for the mixing matrix of the complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> on <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">M(t)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= U(t) \circ U^{*}(t)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \left ( \operatorname{exp}(it(n-1)) E_{n-1} + \operatorname{exp}(-it) E_{-1} \right ) \circ \left ( \operatorname{exp}(it(-(n - 1))) E_{n-1} + \operatorname{exp}(it) E_{-1} \right )</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= E_{n-1} \circ E_{n-1} + \left ( \operatorname{exp}(it(n)) + \operatorname{exp}(it(-n)) \right ) E_{n-1} \circ E_{-1} + E_{-1} \circ E_{-1}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \left ( \frac{1}{n} J \right ) \circ \left ( \frac{1}{n} J \right ) + 2 cos(nt) \left ( \frac{1}{n} J \right ) \circ \left ( I - \frac{1}{n} J \right ) + (I - \frac{1}{n} J) \circ (I - \frac{1}{n} J )</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{1}{n^{2}} J + \frac{2 cos(nt)}{n} (I - \frac{1}{n} J ) + \left ( (1 - \frac{2}{n}) I + \frac{1}{n^{2}} J \right )</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{2 - 2 cos (nt)}{n^{2}} J + \frac{n^{2} - 2n + (2n)cos(nt)}{n^2} I</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{2 - 2 cos (nt)}{n^{2}}(J - I) + \frac{n^{2} - 2n + 2 + 2(n-1)cos(nt)}{n^2} I</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">= \frac{2 - 2 cos (nt)}{n^{2}} A + \frac{n^{2} - 2n + 2 + 2(n-1)cos(nt)}{n^2} I</script>

<p>.</p>

<p>From there, we can deduce that if the complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> on <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices admits uniform mixing at some specific time <script type="math/tex">t \in \mathbb{R}</script>, i.e. <script type="math/tex">M(t) = \frac{1}{n} J</script>, then we must have that <script type="math/tex">\frac{2 - 2 cos (nt)}{n} = \frac{n^{2} - 2n + 2 + 2(n-1)cos(nt)}{n}</script>. Then, we can ultimately infer from this that we must have that <script type="math/tex">cos(nt) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} n</script>, assuming that the complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_n</script> admits uniform mixing at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. It is then apparent that unless <script type="math/tex">n \leq 3</script>, our original assumption cannot be true, since we know that <script type="math/tex">-1 \leq cos(nt) \leq 1</script>. Therefore, we can conclude that the only complete graphs that admit uniform mixing are <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, <script type="math/tex">K_3</script> and <script type="math/tex">K_4</script>, as desired.
Hence we have ultimately verified in this post that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The only complete graph that admits the property known as perfect state transfer is <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only complete graphs that admit the property known as uniform mixing are <script type="math/tex">K_2</script>, <script type="math/tex">K_3</script>, and <script type="math/tex">K_4</script>.
as desired.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
